### Behistun Language

Behistun is a quantum programming language. It aspires to be the link that connects the worlds of quantum mechanics, programming, and category theory. Just like how the trilingual [Behistun inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription) once helped scholars ancient history decipher [cuneiform writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) by comparing words from 3 different languages, the Behistun project also hopes to learn new facts about these 3 different worlds by comparing and transferring facts across domains.
